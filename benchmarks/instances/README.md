Benchmark Instances (Local Snapshots)

- Place JSON files here matching `scripts/bench/dataset/schema.ts`.
- Each file describes a single instance with metadata (order size class, fragmentation, AMM mix, gas regime) and a set of markets with snapshot reserves.

Minimal example in `sample_instance.json`.
